                    Homeopathy is a system of medicine which is based on
                    treating the individual with highly diluted substances given
                    in mainly tablet form, which triggers the body’s natural
                    system of healing. Based on their experience of their
                    symptoms, a homeopath will match the most appropriate
                    medicine to the patient. The term Homoeopathy means &quot;like
                    cures like&quot; means, a substance that would cause
                    symptoms in a healthy person is used to cure those same
                    symptoms in illness. We cannot explain precisely how it
                    works, but new theories in quantum physics are capable of
                    making a reliable conclusion.</p></td>

                    the time&nbsp; including scarlet fever, typhoid, cholera and

                  <td valign="top"><p> Samuel Hahnemann realized that the best way to use similars in the art of curing was to use one single remedy at a time in a very small dose. The small amount of the remedy
                    applied to the patient is an important aspect of this healing art. For this reason, the medium for homoeopathic remedies are very small pills
                    or 2 -3 drops that are often dissolved in water. </p>
                    <p>Hahnemann is quite specific in Organon, #269: “This
                    remarkable transformation of the properties of natural
                    bodies through the mechanical action of trituration and
                    succussion on their particles (while these particles are
                    diffused in an inert dry or liquid substance) develops the
                    latent dynamic powers previously imperceptible and as it
                    were lying hidden asleep in them. These powers electively
                    affect the vital principle of animal life. This process is
                    called dynamization or potentization (development of
                    medicinal power), and it creates what we call dynamizations
                    or potencies of different degrees.”&nbsp; During the homoeopathic pharmaceutical process, the original substance is diluted in specific ratios that produce various degrees of potency. There are three ratios of potentization used in preparing homoeopathic remedies. These are the decimal or X
                    potency, which uses a ratio of 1 to 10; the centesimal or C
                    potency, which uses a ratio of 1 to 100; and the 50 Millesimal or LM potency, which uses a ratio of 1 to 50, 000. Each of these ratios has somewhat different medicinal powers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                    because homeopathic medicines are made from a very small
                    amount of the active ingredient. Two hundred years of
                    practice, research and trials have proved the safety of this
                    gentle system of medicine for both people and animals.
                    Homeopathy is safe to use for babies, children and pregnant
                    and breastfeeding women. Homoeopathy has no side effects but
                    it can create <i>aggravation</i> that occurs during initial
                    treatment with homeopathic remedies. This means that
                    symptoms can temporarily worsen during the process of
                    healing. This aggravation is considered as a positive sign
                    that the remedy is a good match for the patient's symptoms. A properly trained homoeopath should undertake a complete personal interview, individualize the treatment to suit the patient, only use one single remedy at a time, only administer a small amount of the remedy, and be careful not to overmedicate the patient by repeating the dose in a mechanical manner.</p></td>

                    medicine which can effectively treat adults, children,

                    Acute Cases</font>:-&nbsp; Influenza, for instance, would be classified as an acute illness. Chronic diseases, however, are deep-rooted conditions which usually worsen with time. This class of illness includes inherited tendencies, and susceptibilities such as asthma and arthritis. Both categories of illness respond well to homeopathy, but while an acute condition may clear up rapidly, chronic disease involves complex causes which take time to heal.</p><p><font color="#800080">Common
                    Cold:-</font> Many people will suffer from colds at some time in their lives, and many of us regularly 'catch' colds every winter. This acute illness has puzzled research scientists for decades, for they have so far failed to find a cure. Homeopathy can often help in such cases, either by preventing a cold occurring in the first place, or by methodically itemizing individual symptoms and prescribing a remedy on the basis of 'like cures like'.
                    Whatever kind of cold it is, the right remedy taken at the right time will do much to reduce discomfort and clear up the cold as soon as possible.
                    From experience we found that Aconitum 30 would be appropriate for a sudden chill accompanied by a dry, painful cough made worse by cold, dry weather.</p><p><font color="#800080">Allergies:-</font>Homeopathy
                    considers allergies as symptoms of a fundamental chronic
                    condition, and seek to strengthen the body's overall
                    resistance. <font color="#800080"></font>Homeopathy can
                    reduce allergy attacks -or eradicate them altogether.</p><p><font color="#800080">Asthma:-</font>Asthma may prove difficult to treat homeopathically because of long term use of suppressant medications. It is particularly difficult to get a clear homeopathic 'picture' of an adult asthmatic who has a long history of allopathic medication. Many homeopaths are in fact not keen on their patients giving up their inhalers (used during acute attacks), as sudden withdrawal would complicate the picture too much. Instead, they are gradually left and a suitable homeopathic remedy substituted. Therefore homeopathic treatment for adults is a long term undertaking. In case of
                    children, it is possible to control the asthma more easily.
